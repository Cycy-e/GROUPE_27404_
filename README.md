**Oracle Database Project - Student Course Management System**

**1. Introduction**

**Student ID: 27404**

**Name:**

**Concentration: Software Engineering**

**2. Problem Statement**

This project aims to develop a Student Course Management System using Oracle Database. The system is designed to store and manage students, instructors, courses, and enrollments efficiently. It ensures proper data integrity through sequences, constraints, and triggers. Additionally, the system includes essential SQL operations such as DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL.


 **Description of the SQL Commands**

DDL (Data Definition Language): Used to create and modify database structures (e.g., CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE).

DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used for inserting, updating, and deleting records (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

DCL (Data Control Language): Used for controlling access to data (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).

TCL (Transaction Control Language): Manages transactions (e.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT).

**Explanations of the Results and Transactions**

The results from the queries help us analyze student enrollments, courses, and instructor assignments. For example, we can retrieve all students and their enrolled courses, find records added recently, and identify students with more than three enrollments. Transactions help ensure data consistency by allowing rollback and savepoints before making permanent changes.
